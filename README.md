How the game works:

Jump and destroy the balls that float around.
A random magnet will appear occasionally to change your path of movement.
On attaining 30 points, you level up and porcupine-like creatures will appear. On hitting these you lose a health point.
When you have 0 health, the game ends.
You can monitor your level and score in the title bar of the game window.
